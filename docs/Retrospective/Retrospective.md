## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

```
Our definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed
```

- Number of stories committed vs done
  - 3 stories commited - 0 story done
- Total points committed vs done
  - 14 points - 0 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
  - Planned 32h 25m - Spent 42h 55m

### Detailed statistics

| Story   | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_    | 15      | -      | 20h 30m    | 32h 10m      |
| _#1_    | 6       | 8      | 15h 15m    | 10h 35m      |
| _#2_    | 3       | 5      | 2h 10m     | 2h 10m       |
| _#3_    | 3       | 2      | 1h         | n/a          |
| _TOTAL_ | 27      | 15     | 38h 55m    | 44h 55m      |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation):
  - avg: 1.67h \*
  - st. dev: ~2h \*
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 0.86 \*

\* _data is missing or wrongly-reported, statistics are not realiable_

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 5h 20m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 2
  - Coverage (if available): n/a
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: n/a \*
  - Total hours spent: n/a \*
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 1h
  - Total hours spent: 40m

\* _we didn't track time for different types of testing_

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - Lack of experience, both in organizing ourselves and estimating tasks
  - Missing estimation for some tasks
  - Miscommunication

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - Splitting tasks in a meaninful way is harder than expected
  - Team meetings are very important to better organize work and deliver a better product
  - We should dedicate more time to write proper tests
  - Parallelizing work may not always be the right solution, especially if not well organized
  - Team members get along well

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - /
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - /

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - Improve the sprint planning (e.g. learning how to better split tasks) and hold more scrum meetings => improve team coordination and communication, reserve fixed time slots for meetings where all members are available
  - Keep better track of estimated/spent time => technical task, learn how to properly use YouTrack
  - Work e2e on a single story before moving to the next one => technical task

### What are we proud of

- Everyone was ready to help those who had issues
- We are all on the same page about what we did wrong, and we all agree on the improvements we need to make for the next sprint
